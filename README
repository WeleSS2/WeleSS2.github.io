This repository will contain files to display in Capybara Game launcher. 

How to make news?

1. Download github repository.
2. Make a new folder in correct game folder. Name ir correctly (Naming system (KEYWORD_Date_Author_CustomTitle) "CA_14.04.2023_ChaosDwarfsOut", "20.04.2023_Angel321_YTWarhammerHaveSomeFun")
3. Make a news in any text file editor which allow to save file as .html (website format) and save it in your folder as index.html. I reccomend to use Google Docs to create an article and download it as website.
4. Add simple info.txt file with title and short description. Do not use | symbol in title or description, keep title and description in one line.
5. You can add photo or any other image as icon. Name it as "icon.png" (Correct name and .png format are very important) otherwise it will be filled by default with happy capybara face :)
Push it to github and wait for approval.

As example you can take my 1st news.



Which articles will not be approved:
News which are in incorrect folder, have incorrect folder name or files names. 
News not related to Total War games.
News which contain vulgar content, nudity, anything related to profit.
News with multiple files, there should be only 3 files in every folder (I'm not interested in subfolders with images e.t.c.)
News which contain DEV_ keyword or CA_ and are not relataed to official CA_ news.
 
 
 
Do not add everything into uni folder. Keep game content in correct folders.
News will be always taken from the latest, mixed uni folder with game folder. Up to 10 of them.
